# GmaeJam-2018
A game created in a single day for a game jam event held at my uni (we technically had 26 hours for this)
This is the first time I have properly used GameMaker Studio 2 - previous experience before this was only in college working on a simple maze game(similar to pac man - without ghosts chasing you), and a simple shooter game (similar to space invaders)

4 of us worked on this, we all worked together to design the idea and have a goal, however within the game there wasn't time to impliment the story which 1 person created, 1 person basically did nothing but played other games while we worked, as such all work on the game besides art was my own (our artist was amazing - although there was a lot more art intended for this - I'm happy with what we had from a single day)

Personally I am quite impressed with the functionality of the game and the coding for the game, although inefficient (I didn't have time or honestly the knowlege on how to properly structure things using scripts and making use of standard OOP principles) 
This game is the product of having wayyyy too much caffine in a single day, the difficulty of the game is somewhat intentional, the idea was initially that we would have many boss fights against all the planets, where you gain various upgrades for the final fight...which is what you see here. I can personally complete the entire fight without dying, however this isn't consistent for me, and I am considered to be very good at games, and have definitely got experience with difficuly bullet hell games. 

If you can make it to the end of this, then you're honestly amazing and should let me know - bonus points if you record it to show me <3 

This is a project which I will likely not continue, but will be using to salvaage the code and try and create scripts from the code to allow me to eaasily re-use this code over again to make bullet hell patterns similar to the ones in this game

We were going to continue this game as a group for fun, however we didn't really keep in contact, or have enough collective passion to do so, I decided to not work on it either due to other assigments and projects stealing the light, plus I don't feel the game would feel as enjoyable without the same art style which I'm confident I could not re-create :v
